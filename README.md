# RHS TSA Qualifier 2024-2025

My submission to the Redmond High School qualifier for TSA's Data Science event in 2024.

Process is described with the code in the [Jupyter Notebook](main.ipynb) and a summary is available below.

**Steps taken:**

- Preparation and preprocessing
    - Loading of data into DataFrames
    - Dropping missing values if insignificant or filling in if it is required.
    - Converting data types
- Exploratory data analysis
    - Playing around with the data, seeing what conclusions can be made
    - Four topics:
        - Shift Towards Diversity and Social Issues
        - Global Expansion Reflected in Production Countries
        - Simplification of Content Descriptions Over Time
        - Diversity in the Acting Crew Over Time
- Writeup
    - Used LaTeX in the creation of the graphs
    - Used Overleaf (online latex editor)
